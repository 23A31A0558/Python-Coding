# age=8
# print(age.real)
# print(age.imag)
# print(age.bit_length())# it returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. For example, the number 8 can be represented in binary as 1000, which requires 4 bits. Therefore, age.bit_length() will return 4.
